# 🍺 bl_bottleApi API 🚀

Ahoy, mateys! Welcome aboard the BottlePost API! This API is like a digital message in a bottle, tossed into the vast ocean of the internet to bring you the best data on brews from public shores. 🌊

## What's This All About? 🤔

This .NET 6 RESTful API is your first mate when it comes to fetching drink data from a public endpoint. It's not just about grabbing data – it's about churning through the sea of information, calculating, and returning the finest selection of liquid treasure. 🏆

It's a very old Repository of mine and I practically just used it to Proof some concepts
and also kind of to get started with hosting public Repositorys on GitHub.
I'm sorry, if you hoped to find something interesting in here. :P
